Add your own subtitles on almost any video/movie streaming platform you can think of, such as Amazon Prime, Netflix (with some restrictions), Youtube, Twitch and many more!

## Installation

Movie Subtitles is an open-source Chrome Extension and can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.  
To install it please follow [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/movie-subtitles/ifimcneililngppkpddcliecbpcgdjag?hl=de), then click `install`.

## Adding Subtitles

Unfortunately, Movie Subtitles does not have a subtitle search.
You have to download the subtitles online before you can use them in the extension.
There are many websites that offer free subtitles. Two of the most popular ones are [Open Subtitles](https://opensubtitles.org) and [Yify Subtitles](https://yts-subs.com).
Once you've got the subtitles you're good to go!

> Note: Movie Subtitles supports `.txt`, `.srt`, and `.sub` files. If your subtitles are inside a compressed archive/zip folder, you will have to extract/unzip them first.

## Useful Features

Didn't catch a phrase? Listen to it again by clicking the arrow next to the subtitles. Make sure to enable the silence indicator in the settings before using this feature!

> Note that Netflix restricts the functionality of browser extensions. For this reason, some shortcuts and functionalities are not available on Netflix!
